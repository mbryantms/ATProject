Test list-continuation vs new paragraph indentation confusion:

* When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.”


    “Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?”


    “I cannot tell.”


    “Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?”


* “It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.”

    “And you can do nothing until then?”

    “Nothing.”

    “In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.”

    “Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.”
* I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes’ room.

    “Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. “Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?”


When Dottie was an adult, she adopted two baby alligators without knowing quite what to do with them. So she left them in her bathtub until she could decide how to proceed. The next day she was out doing errands when her maid let herself in. Dottie returned to an uncleaned apartment and a note: “Dear Madam. I am leaving, as I cannot work in a house with alligators. I would have told you this before, but I never thought the subject would come up.” [This paragraph should look like a new paragraph after the list ended, not a continuation of the third list item.]

## Math (Block)

$$E = mc^2$$

$$\mathcal{O}(\log(n)) \equiv \mathbb{E}[1]$$

$$\mathbb{E}[x_{i}]\approx \mu+\sigma\Phi^{-1}\left(\frac{i}{N+1}\right)\left[1+\frac{\left(\frac{i}{N+1}\right)\left(1-\frac{i}{N+1}\right)}{2(N+2)\left[\phi\left[\Phi^{-1}\left(\frac{i}{N+1}\right)\right]\right]^{2}}\right]$$

$$P(a|b) = \frac{P(b|a) \cdot P(a)}{(P(b|a) \cdot P(a)) + (P(b|\lnot a) \cdot P(\lnot a))} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.9}{((0.05 \cdot 0.9) + (0.95 \cdot 0.1))} = \frac{0.045}{((0.05 \cdot 0.9) + (0.95 \cdot 0.1))} = \frac{0.045}{(0.045 + (0.95 \cdot 0.1))} = \frac{0.045}{(0.045 + 0.095)} = \frac{0.045}{0.14} = 0.32$$

Color emphasis:

$$\color{red}{\text{red}}(x)$$

$$\color{blue}{\mathcal{O}(\log(n))} \equiv \color{red}{\mathbb{E}[1]}$$

> The possibilities of developing an atomic weapon and the desirability of doing it secretly were discussed at a Princeton University conference in which I participated in March 1939…Bohr said this rare variety could not be separated from common uranium except by turning the country into a gigantic factory. Bohr was worried that this could be done and that an atomic bomb could be developed—but he hoped that neither could be accomplished. Years later, when Bohr came to Los Alamos, I was prepared to say, “You see . . .” But before I could open my mouth, he said: “You see, I told you it couldn’t be done without turning the whole country into a factory. You have done just that.”
